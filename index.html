        <h3>How it works:</h3>
        <p>We all know and love hangman right? Well, we've created an interesting twist on it!<br>
           In this version, you'll be playing hangman, but with file names on your computer.The real twist 
           though comes from the fact that if you lose after 10 attempts, the file will be deleted off your computer forever!</p>
